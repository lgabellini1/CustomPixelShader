# CustomPixelShader
Unreal Engine 5 plugin containing a simple pixel shader, written using the RDG API. This toy post-process shader simply 
performs a "color splash" effect on the scene. It's a didactic example made to learn shader programming in Unreal and extension of 
the Render Dependency Graph.
